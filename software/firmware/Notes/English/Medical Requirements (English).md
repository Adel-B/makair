Medical Requirements
===

We build a respirator adapted to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (rigid lungs that induce a lack of body oxygenation).

**This document sums up our specifications:**

* Mechanical invasive ventilation (medical tube to the lungs; no mask)
* Open circuit (filtering air exhaust is possible)
* An inspiratory pressure that allows to a low normal air volume (6mL/kg/min, with a possibility to push this value to 8), which gives a volume ranging from 300 to 600ml per inspiration)
* A PEEP (Positive end-expiratory pressure) that we should be able to configure from 5 to 15 cmH2O
* A respiratory frequency that must be configured between 15 to 35 per minute
* An inspiration/expiration factor of 1:2
* An intake to allow regular air to be mixed with pure oxygen (before the blower, to increase the air oxygen content on demand)
* A sensor able to measure the plateau pressure, which is allowed up to a maximum of 30cmH2O

**Features:**

* We design a controlled pressure system (in opposition to a controlled volume system)
* The system will display the plateau pressure (and possibly, the peak pressure)
* The medical personnel shall be able to tune the following parameters: PEEP, volume, frequency
